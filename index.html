            <h2>About what I do.</h2>
            <p>
            Using html, css, and javascript, I am able to create seemless user-interface that hopefullly feels intuitive 
            and user-friendly. In my spare time I am currently: <span>working on growing in javascript while I learn python.</span>
            For state driven projects, I am familiar with react. The way state flows through the entire application 
            is very intriguing. For bigger apps to pass data much easier, I am familiar with redux, and a few other state 
            management systems. Using SQL3 and Node.js I am able create and maintain a RESTful database management system.
            I'm also learning Mongo for a project I am working on currently! Big shout out to Lambda school and everyone else who has
            helped me aloing the way! Im excited to see where my coding journey will take me!</p>

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>During my studies at Lambda I've had the pleasure of finishing a great variety of challenges. Here are my favorite from each month of growth.
                     A few projects provided are from a build week. Build weeks take a person/people from each different learning unit, and places individuals 
                     into a team. There are three teams from the web engineering course, one for marketing, front-end, and back-end. Team-work during theese projects 
                     is essential to pass onto to the next unit.</p>

                        <!-- maybe -->
                        <!-- During the first day we were introcued to GitHub, in the first month we learned html and css quickly and effiecently.
                        We dove right into the my current favorite language, javascript. With javascript we learned DOM 
                        manipulation.  -->
                        <p>This project is from my first build week; I was responsible for the marketing page design. Our team
                        collbaorated all week to make sure it all fit together. It was a lot of fun to think about the grand scheme of things
                        as someone who still felt brand new to coding. </p>

                        <h3>Introduction to React</h3>

                        </a> 
                        <p>The second month was very interesting. Our class jumped right into the react tree, and we learned how to create components
                            and pass data in an application with plenty of props drilling! During this unit we learned how to use useState and useEffect
                            to manage the state of an application.</p>

                        </a>
                        <p>By the third month I had become very comfortable with the react tree. By the end of the month we had learned Redux and useContext among 
                            other methods to handle state for larger applications. Reducers and actions were my favorite thing to learn in the program! Redux was one
                            of the biggest challenges I had to invision how data passes through an application.

                        <p>I loved Learning Node and Express, because back end is all the logic puzzles. This is another build-week project. A team-member and I 
                            collaborated all week to deploy our server with postgress. During this week we learned postgress on the fly for our project!
